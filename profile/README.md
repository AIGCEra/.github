## Each Child Window in the Desktop Software has an _Innate Web Gene_, once this Web Gene is activated, this Child Window has a Powerful, Flexible and Web-Based object organization ability, any number of other types of child windows (such as _MFC Windows_, _WinForms, .Net Usercontrols_, _ActiveX Controls_, etc.) can surround it according to the Web Layout. In fact, at this time, the periphery of this child window is _an Infinite Hierarchy Object Structure_ driven by  _Web Descriptions_.<div align=center id="ActivateGene"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26355688/179959927-6de6244f-cd48-416e-a85b-0750c2ec54b1.jpg" width="67%" /></div>When your _Desktop Application Project_ can be used as _the Browser Process of Chromium Project_, and the _Runtime Position_ of a Child Window is only depend on its Parent Window, then the _Web Gene_ of this Child Window will be Activated. <div align=center><br>The Child Window in which the Web Gene <br>is activated is called the [Window Nucleus](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/WinNucleusDef.md).</div><div align=center id="WndNucleusDef"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26355688/179977020-58d5bbd7-51cb-471b-9800-ba297776c7bb.jpg" width="100%" /><div align=center>__([More Information About Window Nucleus ...](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/WinNucleusDef.md))__</div> <br><div align=left>In a sense, each Child Window has the _Potential_ to become something like "_the Galactic Nuclei of those Huge Galaxies in the Universe_".

From Hubble deep space to Webb deep space, unimaginable details in the past appear in our sight. Similarly, when we have _Web Runtime_ in the field of Desktop Software, a scene worthy of expectation will also appear. With the help of Web Runtime, the Desktop Software is enlarged, and the infinite hierarchy of Desktop Window can be displayed, If the surrounding space of many child windows enters our horizon, a magnified universe will surface. Indeed, from the perspective of _Web Runtime_, a desktop software itself is a _Universe_, and Different Desktop Software can be regarded as Different "_Parallel Universes_".</div></div><br><div align=center><div align=center id="WindowNucleus"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26355688/179928057-6d329386-6aa6-4d5b-a41a-6f6e253de23e.jpg" width="80%" /><br>***(When we pay attention to the window nucleus, the appearance around the <br>Window Nucleus opens a new horizon for us, and we see unprecedented changes. <br>Like the Hubble deep space field, the curtain of the new world has opened)***</div>

# [The Technical Strategy of Web Runtime will _Eliminate_ <br>the Boundary between _Desktop Software_ and _Web Browser_](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/document/TechnicalStrategy.md)

<div align=center>

**Thanks to Web Runtime's implementation of _the Dynamic Link Library Version of the Chromium Project_, <br>developers can use their _most familiar development languages_(such as C#, MFC, etc.) and _the most familiar <br>application structure_ (such as the application structure from the _Visual Studio Wizard_) to  develop the "_Browser Process_" <br>of Chromium Project. This strategy will eliminate the Boundary between Desktop Software and Web Browser, <br>and make Web Technology become a part of _Desktop Software Basic Technical Architecture_.**

## Just as every extragalactic galaxy we see through a telescope has a galactic nucleus,  in most cases, those independent desktop windows we see (windows without a parent window) will have at least one window nucleus (except for those that completely owner-draw). Before the advent of large astronomical telescopes, the galaxy we saw was basically a point of light or we thought it was a luminous object, completely unaware that these objects were comparable to our Milky Way. The window nucleus must be surrounded by something, otherwise the concept of "nucleus" will lose its original meaning. The well-known MFC CView object and the .NET Usercontrol object whose Dock property value is "DockFill" or "DockNone" are both typical representative of the window nuclei, the WebView that hosts the Web page is also a well-known window nucleus, the center position of those content windows based on the document concept basically contains a window nucleus ...<br><br><div align=center id="ChildWndGene"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26355688/179455288-7b62f43d-a5e4-4403-bf14-de6c9beb4a25.jpg" width="80%" /></div><div align=left>Because of Hubble telescope, we can see those hundreds of billions of stars around the galactic nucleus, due to we lack infrastructure like "Hubble" in the desktop software field, therefore the space around the window nucleus has not entered the developer's sight, and it is time to change this status quo.</div><div align=right>[more information...](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/document/aboutwndnucleus.md)</div>
