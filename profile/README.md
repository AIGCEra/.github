## The innate Desktop Software Genes enable each Desktop Child Window to have powerful and flexible component organization capabilities, and various window objects can be aggregated around it. Although this gene is innate, how and under what conditions it can be activated are two key questions facing the desktop software. In a sense, each Desktop Child Window could become something like "the galactic nuclei of those huge galaxies in the universe". We know that every Milky Way like galaxy is surrounded by hundreds of billions of stars, WebRuntime acts like a Hubble telescope, allowing us to see under certain conditions each Window Object surrounded by a huge, Web Description-Driven Object Structure.

## **(With the help of Webb and Hubble, people can see an extremely enlarged universe. From Hubble deep space to Webb deep space, unimaginable details in the past appear in our sight. Similarly, when we have webruntime in the field of desktop software, a scene worthy of expectation will also appear. With the help of Web Runtime, the desktop is enlarged, and the infinite hierarchy of desktop window can be displayed, If the surrounding space of many child windows enters our horizon, a magnified universe will surface. Indeed, from the perspective of webruntime, a desktop software itself is a universe, and different desktop software can be regarded as different "parallel universes".)**

# Get to know the _Window Nucleus_ <br>New Web, New Desktop Application World
</div>

**Just as every extragalactic galaxy we see through a telescope has a galactic nucleus,  in most cases, those independent desktop windows we see (windows without a parent window) will have at least one window nucleus (except for those that completely owner-draw).  Before the advent of large astronomical telescopes, the galaxy we saw was basically a point of light or we thought it was a luminous object, completely unaware that these objects were comparable to our Milky Way. The window nucleus must be surrounded by something, otherwise the concept of "nucleus" will lose its original meaning. The well-known MFC CView object and the .NET Usercontrol object whose Dock property value is "DockFill" or "DockNone" are both typical representative of the window nuclei, the WebView that hosts the Web page is also a well-known window nucleus, the center position  of those content windows based on the document concept basically contains a window nucleus...**

</div>

**Because of Hubble telescope, we can see those hundreds of billions of stars around the galactic nucleus, due to we lack infrastructure like "Hubble" in the desktop software field, therefore the space around the window nucleus has not entered the developer's sight, and it is time to change this status quo.**

# The Technical Strategy of Web Runtime will _Eliminate_ <br>the Boundary between _Desktop Software_ and _Web Browser_

<div align=center>

**Thanks to Web Runtime's implementation of _the Dynamic Link Library Version of the Chromium Project_, <br>developers can use their _most familiar development languages_(such as C#, MFC, etc.) and _the most familiar <br>application structure_ (such as the application structure from the _Visual Studio Wizard_) to  develop the "_Browser Process_" <br>of Chromium Project. This strategy will eliminate the Boundary between Desktop Software and Web Browser, <br>and make Web Technology become a part of _Desktop Software Basic Technical Architecture_.**
</div>

<div align=left>

**Developers can develop the _Browser Process_ of the Chromium Project according to their own wishes, which means that completely different from Standard Web Browsers, the First Visible Window can be a Developer-Defined Window (such as WinForms or MFC windows, etc.):**</div>

# The Web Strategy of Web Runtime allows us <br>to build a Larger Web DOM <br>around the Peripheral Space of Window Nucleus

**Every window nucleus can be comparable to the galactic nucleus of a huge galaxy, <br>and the world around it has an infinite level of hierarchy. Let's take WinForms as <br>examples to take a look at the dynamic world around the window nucleus, which <br>is a web driven world that developers have never touched. Once we regard the window <br>nucleus as a galactic nucleus, then every desktop software structure will show a <br>cosmic structure similar to that observed today......**
