## The innate Desktop Software Genes enable each Desktop Window to have powerful and flexible component organization capabilities, and various window objects can be aggregated around it. In a sense, each Desktop Window could become something like "the galactic nuclei of those huge galaxies in the universe". We know that every Milky Way like galaxy is surrounded by hundreds of billions of stars, **WebRuntime** acts like a Hubble telescope, allowing us to see under certain conditions each Window Object surrounded by a huge, Web Description-Driven Object Structure.

## **(With the help of Webb and Hubble, people can see an extremely enlarged universe. From Hubble deep space to Webb deep space, unimaginable details in the past appear in our sight. Similarly, when we have webruntime in the field of desktop software, a scene worthy of expectation will also appear. With the help of webruntime, the desktop is enlarged, and the infinite hierarchy of desktop window can be displayed, If the surrounding space of many windows enters our horizon, a magnified universe will surface. Indeed, from the perspective of webruntime, a desktop software itself is a universe, and different desktop software can be regarded as different "parallel universes".)**

# Application Development

__Web Runtime itself implements _the Dynamic Link Library Version_ of the Chromium Project, <br>which ensures that developers can use their familiar development techniques to construct <br>a browsing process that suits their wishes. In specific applications, other processes of <br>the Chromium project (such as rendering process, GPU process, etc.) are completely preserved.__

<br>__Developers only need to convert their existing or newly created application projects into browsing processes, <br>and then the software Content boils down to a web-based organizational model. Of course, <br>the Web Runtime ensures that the mainstream components(such as .NET, COM and C++, etc.) <br>can be fully incorporated into the new Web DOM system.__
