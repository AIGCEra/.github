**Every Child Window in the Desktop Software has an innate gene, this gene enables it to have a powerful, flexible and Web-based object organization capability, which in turn makes other types of child windows (such as MFC windows, WinForm/Usercontrol, ActiveX Control, etc.) can surround it according to Web layout, how to activate this gene in a Desktop Software and under what _conditions_ can activate this gene are the _core issues of Web Runtime_. In a sense, each Child Window has the potential to become something like "_the Galactic Nuclei of those Huge Galaxies in the Universe_". We know that every Milky Way like Galaxy is surrounded by hundreds of billions of stars, Web Runtime acts like a Hubble Telescope, allowing us to see under certain conditions each Child Window surrounded by a Huge, Web Description-Driven Object Structure.**

**With the help of Webb and Hubble, people can see an extremely enlarged universe. From Hubble deep space to Webb deep space, unimaginable details in the past appear in our sight. Similarly, when we have _Web Runtime_ in the field of Desktop Software, a scene worthy of expectation will also appear. With the help of Web Runtime, the Desktop Software is enlarged, and the infinite hierarchy of Desktop Window can be displayed, If the surrounding space of many child windows enters our horizon, a magnified universe will surface. Indeed, from the perspective of _Web Runtime_, a desktop software itself is a _Universe_, and Different Desktop Software can be regarded as Different "_Parallel Universes_".**

**When a Child Window becomes a Window Nucleus, the inherent genes of the Child Window itself will be activated, and the Desktop Software World will have unprecedented dynamic changes, which urges us to focus on the "Window Nucleus". Because the conditions required by window nucleus are very weak, the impact of window nucleus is extensive.**

**Web Runtime allows developers to develop Windows Desktop Applications based on Chromium Project, and extends the Description Driven Technology of the Web to the Peripheral Space of the Window Nucleus, making developers take Web Technology as the leading role and construct their own Web Application Ecosystem around the key concept of the Window Nucleus. How to convert existing or newly created desktop software projects to projects that match the _Browser Process_ of Chromium Project is the first key problem faced by Web Runtime Development.**

# [Get to know the _Window Nucleus_ <br>New Web, New Desktop Application World](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/document/aboutwndnucleus.md)
</div>

**Just as every extragalactic galaxy we see through a telescope has a galactic nucleus,  in most cases, those independent desktop windows we see (windows without a parent window) will have at least one window nucleus (except for those that completely owner-draw).  Before the advent of large astronomical telescopes, the galaxy we saw was basically a point of light or we thought it was a luminous object, completely unaware that these objects were comparable to our Milky Way. The window nucleus must be surrounded by something, otherwise the concept of "nucleus" will lose its original meaning. The well-known MFC CView object and the .NET Usercontrol object whose Dock property value is "DockFill" or "DockNone" are both typical representative of the window nuclei, the WebView that hosts the Web page is also a well-known window nucleus, the center position  of those content windows based on the document concept basically contains a window nucleus ...**

</div>

**Because of Hubble telescope, we can see those hundreds of billions of stars around the galactic nucleus, due to we lack infrastructure like "Hubble" in the desktop software field, therefore the space around the window nucleus has not entered the developer's sight, and it is time to change this status quo.**

# [The Technical Strategy of Web Runtime will _Eliminate_ <br>the Boundary between _Desktop Software_ and _Web Browser_](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/document/TechnicalStrategy.md)

**Thanks to Web Runtime's implementation of _the Dynamic Link Library Version of the Chromium Project_, <br>developers can use their _most familiar development languages_(such as C#, MFC, etc.) and _the most familiar <br>application structure_ (such as the application structure from the _Visual Studio Wizard_) to  develop the "_Browser Process_" <br>of Chromium Project. This strategy will eliminate the Boundary between Desktop Software and Web Browser, <br>and make Web Technology become a part of _Desktop Software Basic Technical Architecture_.**
