## The innate Desktop Software Genes enable each Desktop Child Window to have powerful and flexible component organization capabilities, and various window objects can be aggregated around it. Although this gene is innate, how and under what conditions it can be activated are two key questions facing the desktop software. In a sense, each Desktop Child Window could become something like "the galactic nuclei of those huge galaxies in the universe". We know that every Milky Way like galaxy is surrounded by hundreds of billions of stars, WebRuntime acts like a Hubble telescope, allowing us to see under certain conditions each Window Object surrounded by a huge, Web Description-Driven Object Structure.

## **(With the help of Webb and Hubble, people can see an extremely enlarged universe. From Hubble deep space to Webb deep space, unimaginable details in the past appear in our sight. Similarly, when we have webruntime in the field of desktop software, a scene worthy of expectation will also appear. With the help of Web Runtime, the desktop is enlarged, and the infinite hierarchy of desktop window can be displayed, If the surrounding space of many child windows enters our horizon, a magnified universe will surface. Indeed, from the perspective of webruntime, a desktop software itself is a universe, and different desktop software can be regarded as different "parallel universes".)**

# The Technical Strategy of Web Runtime will _Eliminate_ <br>the Boundary between _Desktop Software_ and _Web Browser_

<div align=center>

**Thanks to Web Runtime's implementation of _the Dynamic Link Library Version of the Chromium Project_, <br>developers can use their _most familiar development languages_(such as C#, MFC, etc.) and _the most familiar <br>application structure_ (such as the application structure from the _Visual Studio Wizard_) to  develop the "_Browser Process_" <br>of Chromium Project. This strategy will eliminate the Boundary between Desktop Software and Web Browser, <br>and make Web Technology become a part of _Desktop Software Basic Technical Architecture_.**
</div>

<div align=left>

**Developers can develop the _Browser Process_ of the Chromium Project according to their own wishes, which means that completely different from Standard Web Browsers, the First Visible Window can be a Developer-Defined Window (such as WinForms or MFC windows, etc.):**</div>
<div align=center id="WinFormBrowser"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26355688/176896509-92769481-8558-4add-948a-8b0e3e6d2269.jpg" width="45%" /><br>

  **(First Visible Window is a MFC MDI Frame Window)**</div>
<div align=left>
  
  **In a specific Desktop Application, other Processes of the Chromium Project(such as renderer process, GPU process, etc.)are completely preserved. In fact, the difference between _a Desktop Web Browser_ and _a Desktop Application_ is just the difference in the First Web Page, the design principle of the Web Browser is that after the first Web page is opened, a Browser Window is generated. When developers have the ability to develop their own Browser Process, this principle changes when the Browser Process is started. Developers are fully capable of interpreting the First Web Page of the Browser Process as an object they want, in this sense, the Web Browser should be the Smallest Desktop Application System, the Browser Windows(and .NET WinForm Objects) should be a group of objects shared by all Desktop Software. Developers can write Web pages belonging to the application system for their own application systems, and each Web page can open a browser window, of course, can also open a more general window object(such as WinForm). We see that the meaning of a web page changes when the Browser Process can be redefined by the developer...**</div>

# The Web Strategy of Web Runtime allows us <br>to build a Larger Web DOM <br>around the Peripheral Space of Window Nucleus

**Every window nucleus can be comparable to the galactic nucleus of a huge galaxy, <br>and the world around it has an infinite level of hierarchy. Let's take WinForms and Excel as <br>examples to take a look at the dynamic world around the window nucleus, which <br>is a web driven world that developers have never touched. Once we regard the window <br>nucleus as a galactic nucleus, then every desktop software structure will show a <br>cosmic structure similar to that observed today......**

This design makes the Multi-Document-Interface application truly realize the meaning of "Multi-Document".

When MFC View becomes part of the Web DOM, the Doc/View architecture based on traditional technology is dwarfed. In fact, WebRuntime provides developers with greater freedom, allowing developers to incorporate more generalized MFC CWnd derived objects into the scope of the Web DOM. Based on this idea, developers can flexibly use Web technology controls wider objects like "Docking ControlBar" etc......_</div>|
