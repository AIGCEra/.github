## The innate Desktop Software Genes enable each Desktop Window to have powerful and flexible component organization capabilities, and various window objects can be aggregated around it. In a sense, each Desktop Window could become something like "the galactic nuclei of those huge galaxies in the universe". We know that every Milky Way like galaxy is surrounded by hundreds of billions of stars, **WebRuntime** acts like a Hubble telescope, allowing us to see under certain conditions each Window Object surrounded by a huge, Web Description-Driven Object Structure.

## **(With the help of Webb and Hubble, people can see an extremely enlarged universe. From Hubble deep space to Webb deep space, unimaginable details in the past appear in our sight. Similarly, when we have webruntime in the field of desktop software, a scene worthy of expectation will also appear. With the help of webruntime, the desktop is enlarged, and the infinite hierarchy of desktop window can be displayed, If the surrounding space of many windows enters our horizon, a magnified universe will surface. Indeed, from the perspective of webruntime, a desktop software itself is a universe, and different desktop software can be regarded as different "parallel universes".)**

In a specific Desktop Application, other Processes of the Chromium project(such as rendering process, GPU process, etc.) are completely preserved.<hr/>The developer develops the Browsing Process with familiar development technology, which means that the First Created Window may not be the Web Browser Window, but the window that the developer needs(such as a WinForm form form or MFC Window, etc.), which seems to be significantly different from the standard browser.__</div>|

**_The Web Runtime_ enables developers to load a Layout Layer Structure 
<br>between _the Window Nucleus_ and _its Parent Window_ 
<br>using Web or XML DOM Technology at any stage of the Software Runtime**
