With the help of Web Runtime, the Desktop Software is enlarged, and _the infinite hierarchy of Desktop Window_ can be displayed, If the surrounding space of many Window Nuclei enters our horizon, a magnified universe will surface. Indeed, from the perspective of _Web Runtime_, a desktop software itself is a _Universe_, and Different Desktop Software can be regarded as Different "_Parallel Universes_".</div></div></div></div>

# [The Technical Strategy of Web Runtime will _Eliminate_ <br>the Boundary between _Desktop Software_ and _Web Browser_](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/document/TechnicalStrategy.md)

<div align=center>

__Due to Web Runtime's implementation of _the Dynamic Link Library Version of the Chromium Project_, <br>developers can use their _most familiar development languages_(such as C#, MFC, etc.) and _the most familiar <br>application structure_ (such as the application structure from the _Visual Studio Wizard_) to  develop the "_Browser Process_" <br>of Chromium Project. This strategy will completely remove the Boundary between Desktop Software and Web Browser, <br>and make Web Technology become a part of _Desktop Software Basic Architecture_.__

### Web Runtime provides a way with ***very very very limited code adjustments*** for developers to convert existing or newly created _Desktop Software Projects_ to _Browser Processes_ of Chromium Project: <br><br><div align=center><div align=center>__[WinForm](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/document/winformdev.md)__&emsp;&emsp;__[MFC](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/document/mfcexe.md)__</div><div><br></div><div align=left>**When the developer's Application Project is converted into the Browser Process of the Chromium Project, how to control the Peripheral Space of the Window Nucleus based on Web technology is a brand-new Web topic, and a Desktop Software-Related "Web Application Ecological Chain" has revealed the tip of the iceberg.**</div>
