# The Core Obect of Web Runtime: ***[Window Nucleus](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/WinNucleusDef.md)***

### If the _Runtime Position_ of a ***Child Window*** only depends on the <div align=center><br>[WM_WINDOWPOSCHING](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winmsg/wm-windowposchanging)</div><br>Message of its Parent Window, then this Child Window is called a [Window Nucleus](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/WinNucleusDef.md) of its Parent Window. <br>

# __Web Gene of Window Nucleus__
</div>

### ***Every Window Nucleus has an Innate Web Gene***: <br><br><div align=center>__Between any Window Nucleus <br>and its Immediate Parent Window <br>there exists a Web/XML DOM controllable <br>“Window Layout Layer Space Structure” around it.__</div><br><div align=center id="ActivateGene"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26355688/180595187-eb6e5ad5-4d23-460f-95a2-bb09b295daf8.jpg" width="90%"><div>(Web Runtime makes the peripheral space of the window nucleus show its original face. For a long time, because we ignored the existence of peripheral space, a gap between Web and desktop technology was formed.)</div><br><div align=left><div align=left>***For each "Layout" in the "Window Layout Layer Space Structure", any type of child window(such as MFC Windows, WinForms, .Net Usercontrols, ActiveX Controls, ..., etc.) can be used to fill each specific position in the layout. The Web Gene of Window Nucleus enables most Desktop Windows to have Web Description Driven Capabilities comparable to WebView.***</div><br>In fact, the _Periphery_ of Window Nucleus is _an Infinite Hierarchy Object Structure_ driven by  _Web Descriptions_, we see that the Standard Web Technology builds the Web Content inside the WebView, and the Web Gene of the Window Nucleus enables Web Runtime further extends the Web content to the Periphery of the Window Nuclei that widely exist in Desktop Applications. <br>In a sense, every ***Window Nucleus*** has the ***Potential*** to become something like "***the Galactic Nuclei of those Huge Galaxies in the Universe***". We know that every Milky Way like Galaxy is surrounded by hundreds of billions of stars, Web Runtime acts like a Hubble Telescope, allowing us to see under certain conditions each Window Nucleus surrounded by a Huge, Web Description-Driven Object Structure.<br><br><div align=left>With the help of Webb and Hubble, people can see an extremely enlarged universe. From Hubble Deep Space to Webb Deep Space, unimaginable details of the Universe in the past appear in our sight. Similarly, when we have _Web Runtime_ in the field of Desktop Software, a scene worthy of expectation will also appear. With the help of Web Runtime, the Desktop Software is enlarged, and _the infinite hierarchy of Desktop Window_ can be displayed, If the surrounding space of many Window Nuclei enters our horizon, a magnified universe will surface. Indeed, from the perspective of _Web Runtime_, a desktop software itself is a _Universe_, and Different Desktop Software can be regarded as Different "_Parallel Universes_".</div></div></div>

# [The Technical Strategy of Web Runtime will _Eliminate_ <br>the Boundary between _Desktop Software_ and _Web Browser_](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/document/TechnicalStrategy.md)

<div align=center>

__Due to Web Runtime's implementation of _the Dynamic Link Library Version of the Chromium Project_, <br>developers can use their _most familiar development languages_(such as C#, MFC, etc.) and _the most familiar <br>application structure_ (such as the application structure from the _Visual Studio Wizard_) to  develop the "_Browser Process_" <br>of Chromium Project. This strategy will completely remove the Boundary between Desktop Software and Web Browser, <br>and make Web Technology become a part of _Desktop Software Basic Architecture_.__
</div>

<div align=left>

### Web Runtime provides a way with ***very very very limited code adjustments*** for developers to convert existing or newly created _Desktop Software Projects_ to _Browser Processes_ of Chromium Project: <br><br><div align=center><div align=center>__[WinForm](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/document/winformdev.md)__&emsp;&emsp;__[MFC](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/document/mfcexe.md)__</div><div><br></div>
