<h1 align=center><strong>Tribute to Classic</strong>           
<h2>
<p>At different stages of Scientific and Technological Development, there will be classics corresponding to the era to embellish the marvellous of that era. The classic is called a "classic" not only because of its own value, but also because it has a profound impact on a specific historical period. How should we pay tribute to the classics? Letting them conform to the rhythm of the times to continue may be a way to pay homage to the classics. We are lucky because we have benefited from a large number of classics, those who made classics, those achievements let us see further and inspire us to continue to create...<p>

<p>There is no doubt that the Chromium Project is a "fully deserve" classic in the Internet age, Visual Studio Wizard is also a classic that has influenced generations of developers. When we enter the era of Internet entrance competition between Microsoft and Google based on "Chromium Project", we are not only the audience in the giant competition field, of course, we expect to become a member of the competition field, otherwise the Oligarchic Competition stage will become a little boring. Web Runtime attempts to build a larger <i>Web DOM</i> and bring together more classic works. If we can only carry out according to the specifications formulated by chromium, then we are doomed to be spectators, and we may have to applaud the competition between giants, so it is imperative to change the rules.</p>
<p>The mission of Web Runtime is to allow more desktop software developers to inherit the advantages of the Chromium Project to the greatest extent, and at the same time, it can also best continue the technical accumulation of the developers themselves. Further, considering the basic characteristics of Web technology, we hope to reasonably expand the boundaries of the Web, and then the technical resources from the .NET Framework, COM, C++ and many other infrastructures will be incorporated into the scope of the Web.</p>

                            <p>When a Desktop Software Process is converted into a Chromium Browser Process, the Desktop Software Process naturally integrates all the Chromium Browser UI Mechanism from the Chromium technology system, which means that the original UI mechanism is broken. Web Runtime tells us that the breakthrough of the boundary is just the beginning, once the Desktop Process itself has the ability to drive the web, more UI Mechanism parallel to the Browser Window(for example: WinForms UI mechanism) will follow. Every Desktop Application-Oriented Browser Process will contain a structure similar to the Universe, Converting the Desktop Process into the Browser Process is the beginning of this prologue...

                        <p  align=left>The Web Runtime believes the <i>Expressive</i>, <i>Comprehensive</i>, and <i>Powerful</i> Desktop Windows are composed by using the traditional Web DOM to describe various programmable objects (COM, .Net controls, Win32 windows, etc.), rather than created through complex code technology. This is the key reason to the conversion of the Main Process of Desktop Software into a Browser Process. Describing as many objects as possible with the Web DOM is the basic principle of Web Runtime.

</p>

<p align=left>Desktop applications are about to usher in the "<i>Web Page Define Desktop Window</i>" stage, in this sense, Desktop Web Browser should be the "<i>Smallest Desktop Application</i>". When developers can reinterpret the specific UI presentation of Web pages, the boundaries between browsers and desktop applications completely disappear.</p>
