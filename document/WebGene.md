# The __Web Gene of Window Nucleus__
</div>

### ***Every Window Nucleus has an Innate Web Gene***: <br><br><div align=center>__Between any Window Nucleus <br>and its Immediate Parent Window <br>there exists a Web/XML DOM controllable <br>“Window Layout Layer Space Structure” around it.__</div><br><div align=center id="periphery6"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26355688/180608359-54e4d696-5abf-446e-925a-b28f1f078f33.jpg" width="75%"/></div><br><div align=left><div align=left>***For each "Layout" in the "Window Layout Layer Space Structure", any type of child window(such as MFC Windows, WinForms, .Net Usercontrols, ActiveX Controls, ..., etc.) can be used to fill each specific position in the layout. The Web Gene of Window Nucleus enables most Desktop Windows to have Web Description Driven Capabilities comparable to WebView.***</div><br><div align=center id="ActivateGene"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26355688/180607456-856f9d69-389d-4c2b-bd98-c315d10b553e.jpg" width="90%" /></div><div align=center>(Web Runtime makes the peripheral space of the _Window Nucleus_ show its original face. For a long time, because we ignored the existence of peripheral space, a gap between _Web_ and _Desktop_ Software Technology was formed...)</div><br>In fact, the _Periphery_ of Window Nucleus is _an Infinite Hierarchy Object Structure_ driven by  _Web Descriptions_, we see that the Standard Web Technology _builds the Web Content inside the WebView_, and the Web Gene of the Window Nucleus enables Web Runtime further _extends the Web content to the Periphery of the Window Nuclei_ that widely exist in Desktop Applications. <br><br><div align=center id="periphery7"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26355688/180611630-810edca9-c1a4-4100-8df9-046f8e4fc24e.jpg" width="100%"/></div><br><div align=left>In a sense, every ***Window Nucleus*** has the ***Potential*** to become something like "***the Galactic Nuclei of those Huge Galaxies in the Universe***". We know that every Milky Way like Galaxy is surrounded by hundreds of billions of stars, Web Runtime acts like a Hubble Telescope, allowing us to see under certain conditions each Window Nucleus surrounded by a Huge, Web Description-Driven Object Structure.<br><br><div align=center id="periphery5"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26355688/180599198-2c6f7227-fdc3-43e1-ba9d-db97af06a98e.jpg" width="90%"/></div><div align=center>**(When we suddenly find that more and more Desktop Windows can be described by Web Technology, the Desktop Software World in our minds may have to be re-understood ...)**</div><br><div align=left>With the help of Webb and Hubble, people can see an extremely enlarged universe. From Hubble Deep Space to Webb Deep Space, unimaginable details of the Universe in the past appear in our sight. Similarly, when we have _Web Runtime_ in the field of Desktop Software, a scene worthy of expectation will also appear. With the help of Web Runtime, the Desktop Software is enlarged, and _the infinite hierarchy of Desktop Window_ can be displayed, If the surrounding space of many Window Nuclei enters our horizon, a magnified universe will surface. Indeed, from the perspective of _Web Runtime_, a desktop software itself is a _Universe_, and Different Desktop Software can be regarded as Different "_Parallel Universes_".</div></div></div></div>
