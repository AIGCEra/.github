|  <div align=center>**[WinForm Desktop Application System Main Process Executable File Development](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/document/winformdev.md)**</div> |<div align=center>_The existing __WinForm technology__ provides developers with a very convenient way to construct the executable file of desktop applications. Due to the huge difference between this traditional technology framework and modern web technology, its limitations are obvious, undoubtedly, the desktop Internet browser is also a desktop application that relies on Win32 executable files, WebRuntime makes executable files developed by traditional technologies become __the Modern Desktop Internet Portal__, it is the mission of WebRuntime to connect traditional and modern technologies. Webruntime enable that the executable file project formed by __WinForm Technology__ become the beginning of Desktop Internet portal, and this step is a worthy start._</div><div align=center><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26355688/178513189-7108ee88-9bf4-4cca-bea4-ca2ee9a9a3a7.gif" width="100%"/></div>|
| <div align=center>**[WinForm Desktop Application System Runtime Instance State](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/document/mfcexe.md)**</div> |<div align=center>_WebRuntime allows an executable file to have any number of "__Runtime Instance States__", which is significantly different from traditional development techniques. Each "Runtime Instance State" depends on a local folder, and within each such folder contains a configuration file, an initialization Web page and subfolders closely related to the __Runtime State__, data files, and a necessary component of the application system. Different Runtime States have completely different runtime structures, similar to a Second-Order Partial Differential Equation, we know that every Second-Order Partial Differential Equation with clear physical meaning (such as the famous wave equation), Its initial value conditions and boundary conditions determine the physical meaning of the solution of this equation. The description of each __Desktop Application Runtime Instance State__ may determine the structure of a software universe, and the differences between different states can be interpreted as Different Parallel Universes._</div>|  
| <div align=center>**[WinForm Desktop Application System Web Browser Subsystem](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/document/mfcexe.md)**</div> |<div align=center>_Similar to the Android Subsystem in Win11, __Web Runtime__ allows Win32 desktop applications to support the __WebBrowser Subsystem__, which means that each "__Runtime Instance State__" of an __WinForm Desktop Application__ is equivalent to a __Modern Web Browser__. Webruntime allow __Chromium Browser Window__ to use two modes runs in a Win32 application, one is an __Independent Browser Window__, and the other is to allow the Browser Window as a child window to dynamically merge with other __Window Nuclei__ at runtime, so that developers can use the Browser Tabs organize app content within the Win32 window._</div><div align=center id="BrowserSystem"><img src="user-images.githubusercontent.com/26355688/178940820-9d5201d5-5e68-451b-9422-101a5e131980.gif" width="100%"/></div>|  
| <div align=center>**[WinForm Desktop Application System .NET Framework Subsystem](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/document/mfcexe.md)**</div> |<div align=center>_Similar to __Microsoft Visual Basic for Application__, __Web Runtime__ supports __.NET Subsystem__, which means that both WinForm and Usercontrol are  within the scope of “__Content-Oriented WebDOM__” of the application. Developers can instantiate WinForm object instances in web pages, and use WinForm, Usercontrol and MFC View objects and standard DOM elements to synthesize new web pages. Developers can process .NET object events in the page. Web Runtime implements The two-way delegation mechanism makes Web and desktop elements (Win32 elements and WinForm, Usercontrol, etc.) friendly interoperability._</div><div align=center id="webpage62"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26355688/178939412-b4fb3a5c-8a9f-4a48-96f6-2aca73ecdbd1.png" width="100%"/></div>|
