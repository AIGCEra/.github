| <div align=center>**[WinForm Desktop Application System Runtime Instance State](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/document/mfcexe.md)**</div> |<div align=center>_If there is no CFormView or CFormView derived classes in your MFC application, as long as the replacement of the App class base class is completed, the C++ code part required by WebRuntime has been completed. If it contains CFormView or CFormView derived classes, please refer to the following CFormView section. If the application supports the Doc/View architecture, the document serialization please refers to the following serialization section._</dv>|  
| <div align=center>**[WinForm Desktop Application System Web Browser Subsystem](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/document/mfcexe.md)**</div> |<div align=center>_Similar to the Android Subsystem in Win11, WebRuntime allows Win32 desktop applications to support the WebBrowser Subsystem, which means that each "Runtime Instance State" of an __WinForm Desktop Application__ is equivalent to a modern Web browser. Webruntime allow Chromium Browser Window to use two modes runs in a Win32 application, one is an Independent Browser Window, and the other is to allow the Browser Window as a child window to dynamically merge with other window nuclei at runtime, so that developers can use the Browser Tabs organize app content within the Win32 window._</dv>|  
| <div align=center>**[WinForm Desktop Application System .NET Framework Subsystem](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/document/mfcexe.md)**</div> |<div align=center>_Similar to Microsoft Visual Basic for Application, WebRuntime supports .NET Subsystem, which means that both WinForm and Usercontrol are  within the scope of “Content-Oriented WebDOM” of the application. Developers can instantiate WinForm object instances in web pages, and use WinForm, Usercontrol and MFC View objects and standard DOM elements to synthesize new web pages. Developers can process .NET object events in the page. Web Runtime implements The two-way delegation mechanism makes Web and desktop elements (Win32 elements and WinForm, Usercontrol, etc.) friendly interoperability._</dv>|
