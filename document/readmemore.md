<h1 align=center><strong>Tribute to Classic</strong>           
<h2>
<p>At different stages of Scientific and Technological Development, there will be classics corresponding to the era to embellish the marvellous of that era. The classic is called a "classic" not only because of its own value, but also because it has a profound impact on a specific historical period. How should we pay tribute to the classics? Letting them conform to the rhythm of the times to continue may be a way to pay homage to the classics. We are lucky because we have benefited from a large number of classics, those who made classics, those achievements let us see further and inspire us to continue to create...<p>

<p>

There is no doubt that the <i>[Chromium Project](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git)</i> is a "fully deserve" classic in the Internet age, <i>Visual Studio Wizard</i> is also a classic that has influenced generations of developers. When we enter the era of Internet entrance competition between Microsoft and Google based on "<i>[Chromium Project](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git)</i>", we are not only the audience in the giant competition field, of course, we expect to become a member of the competition field, otherwise the Oligarchic Competition stage will become a little boring. [Web Runtime](https://github.com/TangramDev/OpenWebRunTime) attempts to build a larger <i>Web DOM</i> and bring together more classic works. If we can only carry out according to the <i>Specifications Formulated</i> by <i>[Chromium Project](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git)</i>, then we are doomed to be spectators, and we may have to applaud the competition between giants, so it is imperative to change the rules.</p>
<p>

The mission of [<i>Web Runtime</i>](https://github.com/TangramDev/OpenWebRunTime) is to allow more desktop software developers to inherit the advantages of the [<i>Chromium Project</i>](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git) to the greatest extent, and at the same time, it can also best continue the technical accumulation of the developers themselves. Further, considering the basic characteristics of Web technology, we hope to reasonably expand the boundaries of the Web, and then the technical resources from the .NET Framework, COM, C++ and many other infrastructures will be incorporated into the scope of the Web. ...</p>

Everything Starts from the <i>Window Nucleus</i>
</h1>
<h2>
If <i><ins>the Runtime Position</ins></i> of a Desktop Child Window only depends on
<p>
<div align=center>

the [WM_WINDOWPOSCHING](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winmsg/wm-windowposchanging) <br/>Message of its Parent Window,
</div>
</p>
<p>
<p>

then this Child Window is called a [Window Nucleus](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/WinNucleusDef.md) of its Parent Window, any <ins><i>Parent Window</ins></i> of Window Nucleus is called a <ins><i>Nucleated Window</i></ins>.
</p>

<h2>
<p>When we observe the <i>Universe</i> with naked eyes, our <i>intuition</i> will tell us that <i>the Earth</i> is <i>the center of the Universe</i>, and everything will revolve around <i>the Earth</i>. The limited Naked-Eye Horizon of human beings allowed our ancestors to form <i>Geocentric Theory</i> to describe the Universe. Our view of the Universe today is unmatched by the early Geocentric Theory. The advent of <i>Hubble</i> and <i>Webb</i> has allowed us to see the narrowness of the  <i>Geocentric Theory</i>, these survey telescopes allow us to clearly see that the universe is full of extragalactic galaxies, each galactic nucleus may be surrounded by <ins><i>hundreds of billions of stars</i></ins>, allowing us to see a scene that the naked eye cannot reach.</p>

<p>  
Each Desktop <i><ins>Window Nucleus</ins></i> is surrounded by an <i>Infinite-Dimensional, Web-Driven World of Windows</i>, this scene makes <i>the Window Nucleus</i> look very similar to <i>the galaxy nuclei of giant galaxies</i> in the Universe. Due to the lack of infrastructure like <i>Hubble</i> and <i>Webb</i>, this Infinite-Dimensional World has been <i>hidden</i> from developers' sight.</p>

<p>Perhaps we've overlooked something important, we've been ignorant of the huge world of content that surrounds <i>every window nuclei</i> since Desktop Software came out, so the desktop windows we can see are just <i>the tip of the iceberg</i> of <i>the Real Window World</i> (similar to the Universe under the naked eye). the <i><ins>mission of WebRuntime</ins></i> is to reveal the true face of these surrounding worlds for developers, prompting us to rethink the world of desktop software.</p>

<div align=center id="Form1DesignTime"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26355688/199191407-76986b82-5195-4bf6-8c70-fff5f86f8d27.jpg" width="67%"/></div>

<p><i><ins>The Web-driven Surround World</ins></i> around <i>the Desktop Window Object</i> is the <i>Innate Gene</i> of the Desktop Window Object, we call it the "Web nature" of the Window object.</p>

Window Nucleus: New Breakthrough Points of Desktop Software
</h1>
<h2>
<p>Window Nucleus is a widely existing desktop window object. The key factor that determines whether a window object is a window nucleus is a geometric constraint, which makes every window object possible to become a window nucleus. As the name implies, the “window nucleus” means that something must surround it. </p>

<div align=center id="WndNucleus"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26355688/198913804-8c7e198b-71de-4e33-a4d7-60ae0eec4ac2.jpg" width="80%"/></div> 

<p>Every Window Object has the potential to become a "Window nucleus". The discovery of the peripheral world of the Window nucleus allows us to see a new hierarchical structure of the desktop software system. From an astronomical point of view, there are only about 6,000 stars within the human eye's field of vision, which is insignificant compared to the real cosmic scale we see. Similar to the fact that our observable universe contains countless galactic nuclei, every desktop software contains countless window nuclei. If this statement is correct, then we need devices like Hubble and Webb, so that we can clearly understand and see these window nuclei and the surrounds surrounding them. WebRuntime is actually equivalent to a survey telescope like Hubble. When we look at desktop software from the perspective of the universe, WebRuntime allows us to see a cosmic-scale object structure and a brand new Web world. ...</p>

<h1 align=center>
Web-Native Duality
</h1>
<h2>
<p>

The <i>Core Idea</i> of [Web Runtime](https://github.com/TangramDev/OpenWebRunTime) is: every <i>Desktop Window Object</i> has both "<i>Native Nature</i>" and "<i>Web Nature</i>", which is very similar to the "<i>Wave-particle duality</i>" in the field of Physics, which we call the "<i>Web-native duality</i>" of <i>Desktop Window Object</i>.
</p>
<p>

The [Web Runtime](https://github.com/TangramDev/OpenWebRunTime) provides developers with a <p align=center>"<i>[Simplest Technical Strategy](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/document/ConvertWinFormandMFCProjecttoBrowserProcess.md)</i>"</p> <ins>to convert an "existing" or "newly created" <i>Desktop Software Project</i> into "<i>Browser Process</i>" of "Chromium Project"</ins>, and then activate the "Web Nature" of the Window Nucleus, thus realizing Web pageization of "Desktop Application Functions", it completely bridges the gap between <i>the Desktop Software</i> and <i>Web Browser</i> and make Web Technology an inherent part of <i>Desktop Software Architecture</i>.
