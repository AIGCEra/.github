|  <div align=center>**[__MFC Desktop Application System Main Process Executable File Development__](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/document/mfcexe.md)**</div> |<div align=center>_The existing __MFC technology__ provides developers with a very convenient way to construct __the Executable File__ of desktop applications. Due to the huge difference between this traditional technology framework and modern web technology, its limitations are obvious, undoubtedly, __the Desktop Internet Browser__ is also a __Desktop Application__ that relies on Win32 executable files, WebRuntime makes __Executable Files__ developed by traditional technologies become __the Modern Desktop Internet Portal__, it is the mission of WebRuntime to connect traditional and modern technologies. Webruntime enable that the executable file project formed by MFC technology become the beginning of Desktop Internet portal, and this step is a worthy start._</div> <div align=center><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26355688/178922407-5518d8eb-a7db-4cc1-912f-0f03060fbd32.gif" width="100%"/></div>|
| <div align=center>**[__MFC Desktop Application System Runtime Instance State__](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/document/mfcexe.md)**</div> |<div align=center>WebRuntime allows an executable file to have any number of "__Runtime Instance States__", which is significantly different from traditional development techniques. Each "__Runtime Instance State__" depends on a local folder, and within each such folder contains a configuration file, an initialization Web page and subfolders closely related to the runtime state, data files, and a necessary component of the application system. Different Runtime States have completely different runtime structures, similar to a Second-Order Partial Differential Equation, we know that every Second-Order Partial Differential Equation with clear physical meaning (such as the famous wave equation), Its initial value conditions and boundary conditions determine the physical meaning of the solution of this equation. The description of each __Desktop Application Runtime Instance State__ may determine the structure of a software universe, and the differences between different states can be interpreted as Different Parallel Universes._</dv>|  
| <div align=center>**[MFC Desktop Application System: Document Template](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/document/mfcexe.md)**</div> |<div align=center>_Different from the traditional MFC Architecture, WebRuntime enables every __MFC Multi-Document-Interface__ Application System that supports the Doc/View architecture to support the document architecture based on Web technology, which means that every "Runtime Instance State" of such application will support any number of document templates , each document template will have its own object structure. This design makes the Multi-Document-Interface application truly realize the meaning of "Multi-Document". If the traditional MFC Doc/View Architecture is "__rigid__", then the WebRuntime-based Doc/View architecture It can be said to be "__flexible__"._</dv>| 
| <div align=center>**[MFC Desktop Application System: MFC View](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/document/mfcexe.md)**</div> |<div align=center>_Allowing MFC Desktop Applications to support any number of CView-derived objects is one of the places to reflect the flexibility of WebRuntime. When MFC View becomes part of the Web DOM, the Doc/View architecture based on traditional technology is dwarfed. In fact, WebRuntime provides developers with greater freedom, allowing developers to incorporate more generalized MFC CWnd derived objects into the scope of the Web DOM. Based on this idea, developers can flexibly use Web technology controls wider objects like "Docking ControlBar" etc......_</dv>|
| <div align=center>**[MFC Desktop Application System Web Browser Subsystem](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/document/mfcexe.md)**</div> |<div align=center>_Similar to the Android Subsystem in Win11, WebRuntime allows Win32 desktop applications to support the WebBrowser Subsystem, which means that each "Runtime Instance State" of an MFC desktop application is equivalent to a __Modern Web Browser__. Webruntime allow __Chromium Browser Window__ to use two modes runs in a Win32 application, one is an __Independent Browser Window__, and the other is to allow the Browser Window as a child window to dynamically merge with other window nuclei at runtime, so that developers can use the Browser Tabs organize app content within the Win32 window._</dv>|  
| <div align=center>**[MFC Desktop Application System .NET Framework Subsystem](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/document/mfcexe.md)**</div> |<div align=center>_Similar to __Microsoft Visual Basic for Application__, WebRuntime supports __.NET Subsystem__, which means that both WinForm and Usercontrol are  within the scope of “Content-Oriented WebDOM” of the application. Developers can instantiate WinForm object instances in web pages, and use WinForm, Usercontrol and MFC View objects and standard DOM elements to synthesize new web pages. Developers can process .NET object events in the page. Web Runtime implements The two-way delegation mechanism makes Web and desktop elements (Win32 elements and WinForm, Usercontrol, etc.) friendly interoperability._</dv>|
