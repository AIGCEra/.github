| <div align=center>**[MFC Desktop Application System: Document Template](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/document/mfcexe.md)**</div> |<div align=center>_Different from the traditional MFC Architecture, WebRuntime enables every __MFC Multi-Document-Interface__ Application System that supports the Doc/View architecture to support the document architecture based on Web technology, which means that every "Runtime Instance State" of such application will support any number of document templates , each document template will have its own object structure. This design makes the Multi-Document-Interface application truly realize the meaning of "Multi-Document". If the traditional MFC Doc/View Architecture is "rigid", then the WebRuntime-based Doc/View architecture It can be said to be "flexible"._</dv>|
