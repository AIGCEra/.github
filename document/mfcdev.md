| <div align=center>**[__MFC Desktop Application System Runtime Instance State__](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/document/mfcexe.md)**</div> |<div align=center>WebRuntime allows an executable file to have any number of "__Runtime Instance States__", which is significantly different from traditional development techniques. Each "__Runtime Instance State__" depends on a local folder, and within each such folder contains a configuration file, an initialization Web page and subfolders closely related to the runtime state, data files, and a necessary component of the application system. Different Runtime States have completely different runtime structures, similar to a Second-Order Partial Differential Equation, we know that every Second-Order Partial Differential Equation with clear physical meaning (such as the famous wave equation), Its initial value conditions and boundary conditions determine the physical meaning of the solution of this equation. The description of each __Desktop Application Runtime Instance State__ may determine the structure of a software universe, and the differences between different states can be interpreted as Different Parallel Universes._</div>|  
| <div align=center>**[MFC Desktop Application System: Document Template](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/document/mfcexe.md)**</div> |<div align=center>_Different from the traditional MFC Architecture, WebRuntime enables every __MFC Multi-Document-Interface__ Application System that supports the Doc/View architecture to support the document architecture based on Web technology, which means that every "Runtime Instance State" of such application will support any number of document templates , each document template will have its own object structure. This design makes the Multi-Document-Interface application truly realize the meaning of "Multi-Document". If the traditional MFC Doc/View Architecture is "__rigid__", then the WebRuntime-based Doc/View architecture It can be said to be "__flexible__"._</div>| 
| <div align=center>**[MFC Desktop Application System: MFC View](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/document/mfcexe.md)**</div> |<div align=center>_Allowing MFC Desktop Applications to support any number of CView-derived objects is one of the places to reflect the flexibility of WebRuntime. When MFC View becomes part of the Web DOM, the Doc/View architecture based on traditional technology is dwarfed. In fact, WebRuntime provides developers with greater freedom, allowing developers to incorporate more generalized MFC CWnd derived objects into the scope of the Web DOM. Based on this idea, developers can flexibly use Web technology controls wider objects like "Docking ControlBar" etc......_</div>|
