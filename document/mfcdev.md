If it contains CFormView or CFormView derived classes, please refer to the following CFormView section. If the application supports the Doc/View architecture, the document serialization please refers to the following serialization section._</dv>|  
| <div align=center>**[MFC Desktop Application System: Document Template](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/document/mfcexe.md)**</div> |<div align=center>_Different from the traditional MFC Architecture, WebRuntime enables every __MFC Multi-Document-Interface__ Application System that supports the Doc/View architecture to support the document architecture based on Web technology, which means that every "Runtime Instance State" of such application will support any number of document templates , each document template will have its own object structure. This design makes the Multi-Document-Interface application truly realize the meaning of "Multi-Document". If the traditional MFC Doc/View Architecture is "rigid", then the WebRuntime-based Doc/View architecture It can be said to be "flexible"._</dv>| 
| <div align=center>**[MFC Desktop Application System: MFC View](https://github.com/TangramDev/.github/blob/main/document/mfcexe.md)**</div> |<div align=center>_Allowing MFC Desktop Applications to support any number of CView-derived objects is one of the places to reflect the flexibility of WebRuntime. When MFC View becomes part of the Web DOM, the Doc/View architecture based on traditional technology is dwarfed. In fact, WebRuntime provides developers with greater freedom, allowing developers to incorporate more generalized MFC CWnd derived objects into the scope of the Web DOM. Based on this idea, developers can flexibly use Web technology controls wider objects like "Docking ControlBar" etc......_</dv>|
